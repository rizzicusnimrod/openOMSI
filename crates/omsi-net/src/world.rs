//! The host's world as the clients see it (`WORLD`): the AI traffic, the people on the
//! pavements and at the stops, the riders of the timetable buses and the traffic lights
//! around each client, bit-packed.
//!
//! The host simulates the shared world alone; a client draws what the host sends and
//! simulates only its own bus (and the passengers that board it, see `CLAIM`). Every
//! datagram is complete in itself - the pose of each thing it lists, not a change against
//! an earlier one - so a lost datagram only delays the things it carried until the next
//! one. Things that move are sent ten times a second, things that stand once a second; a
//! client that has heard nothing of something for `FORGET_AFTER` lets it go, and the host
//! also names what it took away (`gone`).
//!
//! Positions are centimetres from an anchor near the client (whole metres in the header),
//! so that they fit into 19 bits (±2.6 km) whatever the map's world coordinates:
//!
//! ```text
//! byte 0      0xB4
//! byte 1      protocol version
//! bytes 2-3   sequence number (little endian, wraps)
//! bytes 4-7   the host's clock (ms since its session began, little endian, wraps)
//! bytes 8-15  anchor x, y (whole metres, i32 little endian)
//! bytes 16-17 anchor z (whole metres, i16 little endian)
//! then, least significant bit first:
//!   cars 7, each:
//!     id 24, x 19, y 19 (cm), z 17 (cm), heading 12 (360/4096 deg), pitch 8, bank 8
//!     (0.1 deg), speed 11 (0.05 m/s, signed), steer 8 (0.5 deg, + right), indicators 2,
//!     brake 1, lights 1, at the stop 2 (0 no, 1 boarding, 2 leaving)
//!   people 8, each:
//!     id 24, where 2 (0 on foot, 1 aboard a timetable bus, 2 aboard a player's bus),
//!     activity 2 (stand, walk, sit, run)
//!     on foot: x 19, y 19, z 17 (cm), heading 8 (360/256 deg), speed 6 (0.05 m/s),
//!       waiting 1 (then: stop 32, the stop object's id, and its waiting place 8)
//!     aboard: bus 24 (the car's id, or the player's), x 12, y 13, z 10 (cm in the bus frame), heading 8, seat 8 (255:
//!       none - walking, at the desk or the door)
//!   lights 6, each: crossing object 32, cycle position 17 (0.05 s), held 1
//!   gone 6, each: kind 1 (0 car, 1 person), id 24
//!   (first datagram, once a second) parked 1: then complete 1, count 7, each: the map
//!   id of a parking space whose car has driven off 32
//!   (the custom fork) looks: tag 4 (0b1010), then for each car above, in order: rear fog
//!   lamp 1, high beams 1, horn toots so far 2 (wrapping), broken bulb 3 (0 none, 1 head
//!   left, 2 head right, 3 brake left, 4 brake right), a smoky two-stroke 1 - what its

//!
//! A car takes 17 bytes, a person 12 (17 while waiting at a stop), a light program 6.
